                <h3>Yoga</h3>

                <h3>Mindfulness</h3>
                <p>
                    Mindfulness is a type of meditation but it kind of different in a way.
                    Meditation focuses more on reeling in your thoughts to calm your mind,
                    however Mindfulness focuses on being more aware of what you're sensing
                    and/or feeling in any given moment without interpretation or judgment.
                    It's feeling your emotions but not being controlled by them.
